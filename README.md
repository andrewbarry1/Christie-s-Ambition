CHRISTIE'S AMBITION
===================

This is a strategy game I made for a game jam. WARNING: expect game jam-quality code.
I made this game using C# with MonoGame in Visual Studio 2015.

Much like it's namesake, the long-running Japanese series "Nobunaga's Ambition," the goal of this game is unificiation.
However, rather than unifying Japan, your goal is to unify New Jersey.

You can download a windows build of the game [here.](http://andrewbarry.me/GameJam/)
